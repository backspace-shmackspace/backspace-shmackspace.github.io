I've been in Software Development since 1998, starting out writing vbscript in Active Server Pages for a small `.com` startup. 
Since then I've worked for big and small companies across a wide variety of industries:
* e-Learning
* Energy
* Justice
* Prisons & Corrections
* Electronic Health Records
* Mobile Tech 
* Cloud (AWS)
* Cyber Security

In September 2018, I participated in my first CTF.
I was immediately hooked and soon after discovered HTB as
a playground to learn new skills and to increase my overall security
knowledge. I use this information almost daily in my work and at home.
